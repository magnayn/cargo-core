All Cargo documentation is available on Cargo's website on:

  http://cargo.codehaus.org
  
This directory contains additional documentation-related files. Namely:
- original Microsoft PowerPoint documents used to draw the diagrams found on the website
- source code snippets referenced on the website (using the Confluence {snippet} macro - see 
  http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Snippet+Macro+Library). We're using this macro
  to ensure that the examples on the website are always in sync with the code

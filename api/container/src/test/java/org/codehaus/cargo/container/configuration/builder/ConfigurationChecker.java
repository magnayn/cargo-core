/**
 * <h2>Overview</h2> Implementors of <code>DataSourceConfigurationChecker</code> ensure basic
 * coverage of {@link ConfigurationBuilder} in a way that can be automated. It does this
 * by providing methods for every known configuration of a {@link DataSource}<br>
 * <h2>Usage</h2> Implementors will be called by tests who implement
 * {@link ConfigurationBuilderTests} or
 * {@link LocalConfigurationWithConfigurationBuilderTests}.<br>
 * <code>DataSourceConfigurationChecker</code> will be called from both of these contexts to help
 * developers isolate where configuration problems arise.
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>ConfigurationBuilderTests</code> test the ability of a
 * ConfigurationBuilder to produce the correct configuration string based on the type of
 * <code>DataSource</code>.</li>
 * <li> <code>LocalConfigurationWithDataSourceSupportTests</code> test the ability of a
 * <code>LocalConfiguration</code> to use <code>ConfigurationBuilder</code> appropriately
 * such that those entries are written to the correct place in the correct file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The methods mean what they say and all take two parameters:
 * <ol>
 * <li>configuration - this is what your implementation of {@link ConfigurationBuilder}
 * created for the context of this test.</li>
 * <li>dataSourceFixture - this is the inputs that should relate directly to the configuration
 * built.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * Implementation Guidance:<br>
 * To implement one of these methods, you will need to scrub <code>configuration</code> for evidence
 * of being created correctly.<br>
 * For example, most implementations write XML. If dataSourceFixture.url was null for a check, you
 * should verify that the configuration doesn't include the word 'null', as such a thing would
 * certainly break a container. <br>
